# What is a Design Pattern?

Design Patterns are solutions to common problems that eventually appears while developing a software. Design Patterns are good because they use best practices for solving problems. It works like a template of how to solve a common problem. 

## Facade Pattern

Facade Pattern encapsulates the complexity of a system, library or API. You use a facade when you i.e. need to use a authentication library that has bunch of methods but you just need some methods, the login e logout methods.
Facade will wrap the complexity of a interface and makes the code looks simpler to client that consumes it.

## Adapter Pattern

Adapter Pattern is used when you want to use a interface as another interface that is incompatible.

## Decorater Pattern

Decorator Pattern adds and changes the behavior of an object at runtime. Unlike inheritance, the behaviors changes do not affect others objects. Inheritance changes behavior at compile time meanwhile decorator pattern does it at runtime.
